Combine Reclaim.ai with Canvas for automatic task scheduling.

For now, the program looks at all my Canvas assignments for each class and adds them to Reclaim if they have not already been added. I have special logic that sets the number of hours of each class based on the assignment type.

In the future, I will have an AI system such as GPT-4 control this for me automatically with minimal supervision. It predicts the number of hours I need based on its intuition and previous similar assignments I have done.
